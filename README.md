# Julia `^` Operator Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the exponentiation operator (`^`) in Julia. The issue is not related to a specific Julia version but rather an unexpected behavior for negative numbers and zero.  This behavior can be subtle and lead to incorrect results in scientific or mathematical calculations.  The `bug.jl` file showcases the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected implementation.

## Bug Description

When using the `^` operator in Julia, behavior with negative bases and integer exponents can vary from expected mathematical behavior.  This is especially relevant when dealing with floating-point numbers near zero or large exponents.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to avoid unexpected issues.  For example, by using the `pow` function explicitly you can often get more predictable behavior.
